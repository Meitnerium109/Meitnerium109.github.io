description: A fast paced platformer game. I did all the graphics and special effects in this game. Built with FlashDevelop (pure code, no GUI) using actionscript 3 and the flixel game development framework. You can play the game on my <a href="http://www.gamesonly.com/action-games/pixel-dash.html"> sponsor's website </a>. Unfortunately, I can't release the source code due to the terms of sponsorship.
description2: You can read more about the game and the development process in my <a href="No Blog Post Yet">blog post</a>.
